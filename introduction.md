# Introduction
Linux is a free and open-source family of operating systems that is resilient and flexible. In 1991, an individual by the name as Linus Torvalds constructed it. The systemâ€™s source code is accessible to everyone for anyone to look at and change, making it cool that anyone can see how the system works. People from all across the world are urged to work together and keep developing Linux due to its openness.


### Linux History
Linus Torvalds designed the free and open-source Linux operating system kernel in 1991. Torvalds set out to develop a free and flexible system for personal computers, drawing ideas from the UNIX operating system and the MINIX operating system. Teamwork in development was encouraged with the initial release of the Linux kernel, which attracted developers and enthusiasts globally quickly. Various open-source software packages integrated with the Linux kernel created fully operational operating systems, occasionally referred to as Linux distributions.


### Why use Linux?
Because it is free, open-source, and extremely flexible, Linux is widely utilized. For servers and developers, it is the ideal option because it offers strong security, stability, and performance. Generally interoperable hardware, a broad software library, and a vibrant community that offers support and regular updates are the many benefits of Linux. Due to its adaptability, users can customize the operating system according to their own needs, whether they become for personal or large enterprise use.
